  
       programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
       
           types of programming languages:
               1. low-level programming languages
                   - machine language
                   - assembly language
               2. high-level programming languages
                   - procedural programming languages
                   - object-oriented programming languages
                   - functional programming languages
                   - scripting programming languages
                   - logic programming languages
