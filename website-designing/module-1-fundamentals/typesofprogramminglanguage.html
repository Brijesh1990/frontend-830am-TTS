<!-- what is programming :
       programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.
       
       programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
       
           types of programming languages:
               1. low-level programming languages
                   - machine language
                   - assembly language
               2. high-level programming languages
                   - procedural programming languages
                   - object-oriented programming languages
                   - functional programming languages
                   - scripting programming languages
                   - logic programming languages
               
           examples of programming languages:
               - Python
               - Java
               - C++
               - JavaScript
               - Ruby
               - PHP
               - Swift
               - Go
               - Rust
               - Kotlin
               
           choosing a programming language:
               factors to consider:
                   - project requirements
                   - performance needs
                   - developer expertise
                   - community support
                   - ecosystem and libraries
